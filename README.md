This is a simple netforce visualizer and calculator that generates a visual of the forces on an object, and then calculateds that net force in the x and y directions.

RUN THE VECTORS FILE, this will change in the future to a main.py, but this is very early development

The road map is as follows:
- add removing of vectors
- add change in x/y coord system (so you can "rotate" what is up and down, left and right
- multibody diagrams
